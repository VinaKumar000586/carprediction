This project focuses on predicting car prices based on various features such as year, make, model, condition, odometer reading, transmission type, and other car attributes. The model applies different machine learning techniques to build a predictive model that can estimate the selling price of a car

Description of the Model:
Data Loading: The dataset is loaded using Dask, a parallel computing framework, for efficient handling of large datasets. The data is read from a CSV file (car_prices.csv), and basic information about the data (e.g., columns, missing values) is explored
